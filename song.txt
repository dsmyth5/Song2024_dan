A Song about Rainbows ðŸŒˆ

In fields of emerald, where dreams unfurl,
Where golden flowers dance in endless swirl,
A distant glimmer, a promise bright,
A rainbow's arch, a celestial light.

A bridge of colors, a path to the sky,
A promise of hope, a reason to try,
A symbol of peace, a sign of grace,

A rainbow's beauty, a smile on God's face.
